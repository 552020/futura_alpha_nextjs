# Import ICP Frontend Configuration

## Overview

We need to import and analyze the ICP frontend configuration to understand how to integrate it with our existing Next.js application.

## Key Files to Analyze

- `vite.config.js` - Main build configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `src/frontend/package.json` - Frontend-specific dependencies
- `dfx.json` - Internet Computer deployment configuration
- `src/frontend/src/App.jsx` - Main application component

## Tasks

1. [ ] Copy and analyze `vite.config.js` configuration
2. [ ] Review frontend dependencies and build setup
3. [ ] Understand ICP-specific configurations
4. [ ] Plan integration strategy with existing Next.js app
5. [ ] Identify potential conflicts or compatibility issues

## Notes

- The project uses Vite for frontend building
- Has both backend (Rust) and frontend (React/JSX) components
- Uses Internet Computer deployment configuration (dfx.json)
- Frontend is located in `src/frontend/` directory

## Status

```js
// Node.js built-in modules for file path resolution - used to resolve the path to declarations directory for ICP canister types
import { fileURLToPath, URL } from "url";
// Vite-specific React plugin - not relevant for Next.js integration
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
// Vite config function - not relevant for Next.js integration
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
// For retrieving and setting environment variables
import environment from "vite-plugin-environment";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config({ path: "../../.env" });

// dotenv reads variables from .env file → Node.js process
// vite-plugin-environment takes variables from Node.js process → makes them available in browser

export default defineConfig({
  // Vite-specific build config - Next.js handles output directory management automatically
  build: {
    emptyOutDir: true,
  },
  // Vite-specific dependency optimization - Next.js handles bundling and optimization differently
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      define: {
        global: "globalThis",
      },
    },
  },
  // Vite development server proxy - forwards /api requests to local DFX server (ICP canisters)
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://127.0.0.1:4943",
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [react(), environment("all", { prefix: "CANISTER_" }), environment("all", { prefix: "DFX_" })],
  resolve: {
    alias: [
      {
        find: "declarations",
        replacement: fileURLToPath(new URL("../declarations", import.meta.url)),
      },
    ],
    dedupe: ["@dfinity/agent"],
  },
});
```

## Environment Variable Flow Explanation

The environment variable handling in this Vite configuration works through a two-step process that bridges the gap between file-based configuration and browser-accessible variables. First, `dotenv.config({ path: "../../.env" })` reads environment variables from the specified `.env` file located in the parent directory and loads them into the Node.js process environment (`process.env`). This makes variables like `CANISTER_ID` and `DFX_NETWORK` available to the Node.js server running the Vite development server.

Then, the `vite-plugin-environment` plugin takes these server-side environment variables and makes them accessible in the browser through Vite's build-time injection mechanism. This plugin is configured with two prefixes: `"CANISTER_"` and `"DFX_"`, which means it will expose any environment variables that start with these prefixes to the client-side code. For example, if your `.env` file contains `CANISTER_ID=abc123` and `DFX_NETWORK=local`, the plugin will make these available in your React components as `import.meta.env.CANISTER_ID` and `import.meta.env.DFX_NETWORK`.

This setup is crucial for ICP development because the frontend needs to know which canisters to connect to and which network to use, but environment variables are typically only available on the server side. The combination of dotenv and vite-plugin-environment solves this by first loading the variables from the file system into the Node.js process, then injecting them into the client-side bundle during the build process, allowing the React application to access ICP-specific configuration at runtime.

## Development Server Proxy Configuration

The `server.proxy` configuration in the Vite setup forwards all `/api` requests to the local DFX development server running on `http://127.0.0.1:4943`. This is the standard port where DFX runs the local Internet Computer replica for development.

**For Next.js Integration Challenge**: In our setup, we'll have a dual-backend architecture during development:

1. **Next.js API routes** (Vercel backend) - for normal application functionality
2. **DFX local server** (`127.0.0.1:4943`) - for ICP canister communication

This creates a routing challenge where we need to determine which backend should handle which requests. Possible solutions include:

- **Path-based routing**: Route `/api/icp/*` to DFX server, `/api/*` to Next.js API routes
- **Next.js rewrites**: Configure specific API paths to proxy to the DFX server
- **Client-side routing**: Make direct calls to DFX for ICP operations, use Next.js API for everything else

The original Vite setup was simpler because it only needed to communicate with ICP canisters, but our Next.js integration needs to support both traditional backend operations and ICP blockchain interactions.

**Important Discovery**: After analyzing the actual frontend code, it was found that the ICP frontend **does not use HTTP API calls at all**. Instead, it uses **direct canister communication** through the `@dfinity/agent` library:

```js
import { futura_alpha_icp_backend } from "declarations/futura_alpha_icp_backend";

// Direct canister call, not HTTP API
futura_alpha_icp_backend.greet(name).then((greeting) => {
  setGreeting(greeting);
});
```

This means the proxy configuration in the Vite setup is **unused** and can be ignored for Next.js integration. The frontend communicates directly with ICP canisters from the browser, eliminating the need for complex routing between different backend systems. This significantly simplifies the integration strategy.

## Frontend-Backend Communication Flow

### 1. **Import the Backend Interface**

```javascript
import { futura_alpha_icp_backend } from "declarations/futura_alpha_icp_backend";
```

This imports the **auto-generated TypeScript/JavaScript interface** for the Rust backend canister.

### 2. **Direct Canister Calls**

```javascript
futura_alpha_icp_backend.greet(name).then((greeting) => {
  setGreeting(greeting);
});
```

### 3. **How It Works Under the Hood**

**During Development:**

- DFX runs a local replica at `http://127.0.0.1:4943`
- The `futura_alpha_icp_backend` interface automatically handles:
  - Serialization/deserialization of data
  - HTTP requests to the local replica
  - Authentication and session management

**In Production:**

- The same interface communicates with the deployed canister on the Internet Computer
- No HTTP proxy needed - direct IC protocol communication

### 4. **The Interface Generation Process**

1. **Rust Backend** (`src/backend/src/lib.rs`):

   ```rust
   #[ic_cdk::query]
   fn greet(name: String) -> String {
       format!("Hello, {}!", name)
   }
   ```

2. **Candid Interface** (`src/backend/backend.did`):

   ```
   service : {
       "greet": (text) -> (text) query;
   }
   ```

3. **Auto-generated JS/TS Interface** (in `declarations/`):
   - DFX automatically generates TypeScript/JavaScript bindings
   - Provides type-safe function calls
   - Handles all the low-level communication details

### 5. **Why No Traditional HTTP API?**

This is **not** a traditional REST API setup. Instead, it uses:

- **Candid**: Interface definition language for IC
- **Agent**: Handles authentication and communication
- **Canister calls**: Direct function calls to deployed smart contracts

This approach gives you:

- **Type safety** across frontend and backend
- **Automatic serialization**
- **Built-in authentication**
- **Seamless local/production deployment**

## Auto-Generated Declaration Files

The `declarations/` directory contains auto-generated TypeScript/JavaScript files that provide the interface between frontend and backend:

### Key Files:

- **`index.d.ts`** - TypeScript definitions for the canister interface
- **`backend.did.d.ts`** - Service interface definition (`_SERVICE` with `greet` method)
- **`index.js`** - Runtime implementation with `createActor` and `backend` exports
- **`backend.did`** - Candid interface definition

### Why They're Needed:

1. **Type Safety**: `_SERVICE` interface ensures frontend calls match backend functions
2. **Canister ID Management**: Automatically reads `CANISTER_ID_BACKEND` from environment
3. **Agent Configuration**: Handles local development vs production network switching
4. **Actor Creation**: Provides `createActor()` function to instantiate canister connections

### Example Usage:

```typescript
import { backend } from "declarations/backend";

// Type-safe call to backend canister
const greeting = await backend.greet("World");
```

These files are **essential** for the frontend to communicate with ICP canisters - they provide the bridge between JavaScript/TypeScript and the Rust backend running on the Internet Computer.
