# Gallery Redesign: Pixieset-Style Simple Gallery

## Current State

The current gallery implementation is overly complex and misunderstood the purpose. It was built as a photo management system with search, filters, and individual memory viewing - similar to a dashboard for individual photos.

## Problem

The gallery should be a **simple, elegant photo gallery** like Pixieset, not a photo management system. The current implementation is:

- Too complex with search/filter/sort functionality
- Treating it like a dashboard for individual memories
- Missing the core gallery experience

## Requirements: Pixieset-Style Gallery

### Core Concept

A **super simple gallery** with:

- **Front/cover image** that represents the entire gallery
- **Just images** - clean, minimal interface
- **No complex UI** - focus on the photos themselves

### Key Features

1. **Cover Image**

   - Large, prominent cover image that represents the gallery
   - Could be the first image or a selected representative image
   - Full-width display with elegant presentation

2. **Search & Filter (Reused from Dashboard)**

   - Beautiful search bar with icon and placeholder text
   - Filter by image type (if needed)
   - Clean, elegant search experience
   - Reuse existing search components and styling

3. **Image Grid**

   - Simple grid layout of images
   - Clean, minimal interface
   - Focus on visual presentation
   - Responsive grid design

4. **Simple Navigation**
   - Click to view individual images
   - Basic gallery navigation (previous/next)
   - No complex management features

### Design Inspiration

- **Pixieset galleries** - clean, elegant, photo-focused
- **Wedding photography galleries** - simple, beautiful presentation
- **Portfolio-style** - let the images speak for themselves

### Technical Requirements

- **Keep the beautiful search functionality** from dashboard (reuse existing components)
- Remove complex UI elements (badges, tags, favorites, etc.)
- Focus on image display and simple navigation
- Keep authentication protection
- Maintain responsive design
- Reuse existing search bar design and functionality

### User Experience

- **Photographer/Client**: Simple, elegant way to view photos
- **Wedding/Event**: Beautiful presentation of event photos
- **Portfolio**: Clean showcase of work

## Implementation Plan

1. Simplify the gallery page to focus on image display
2. Remove complex UI elements and functionality
3. Implement simple image grid with cover image
4. Add basic image viewer/navigation
5. Keep the existing sample images for testing

## Success Criteria

- Gallery looks and feels like a professional photo gallery
- Simple, elegant user experience
- Focus on visual presentation over functionality
- Responsive and performant
- Easy to navigate and view images

## Notes

- This is for the **wedding vertical** primarily
- Should feel like a professional photography gallery
- Keep it simple - "just images" as requested
- Remove all the dashboard-like complexity
