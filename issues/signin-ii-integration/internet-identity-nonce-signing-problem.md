# Internet Identity Nonce Signing Problem

## **Problem Statement**

We're implementing Internet Identity (II) authentication for our Next.js application and need to implement **proof-of-possession** using nonces. However, we've discovered that the II design doesn't expose the session private key for signing arbitrary messages.

## **Our Current Implementation**

### **What we have working:**

1. ✅ II authentication with `AuthClient.login()`
2. ✅ Getting user principal and identity
3. ✅ Fetching nonce from Web2 backend (`/api/ii/challenge`)
4. ✅ Registering user on Web3 canister
5. ❌ **Signing nonce with delegated key** (this is the problem)

### **What we tried:**

```typescript
// This doesn't work - Identity interface doesn't have sign() method
const signature = await identity.sign(nonceBytes);
```

## **The Core Issue**

### **What we expected:**

- II would expose the session private key for signing arbitrary messages
- We could sign the nonce to prove possession of the key

### **What actually happens:**

- II only exposes the **delegation chain** (public key + delegation proof)
- The **session private key** is kept private by II for security reasons
- The `Identity` interface is designed for **canister calls**, not general signing

## **Why this is a problem:**

1. **Security requirement:** We need proof that the user controls the key
2. **Web2 integration:** NextAuth needs to verify the user's identity
3. **Nonce verification:** Without signing, anyone could fake a principal

## **Questions for ICP Docs AI:**

1. **Is there a standard way to implement proof-of-possession with II?**
2. **Should we use canister-backed proof instead?** (Make canister call that records "principal X proved nonce Y")
3. **Is there a different authentication pattern we should follow?**
4. **Are there any official examples of II + Web2 integration with nonces?**

## **Alternative approaches we're considering:**

### **Option A: Canister-backed proof**

```typescript
// 1. Web2 issues nonce
// 2. User makes authenticated canister call: proveNonce(nonce)
// 3. Canister records: "principal X proved nonce Y"
// 4. Web2 verifies by calling canister: verifyNonce(nonce, principal)
```

### **Option B: Server-side delegation verification**

```typescript
// 1. Client sends delegation chain + signature
// 2. Server verifies delegation chain validity
// 3. Server verifies signature using public key from chain
```

### **Option C: Different authentication strategy**

- Use a different approach entirely
- Skip nonce verification for now (less secure)

## **Current Status**

We have a **placeholder implementation** for step 4.4 (signing nonce) that doesn't actually work. We need guidance on the correct approach.

**Help needed:** What's the recommended approach for implementing proof-of-possession with Internet Identity when integrating with traditional Web2 authentication systems?
