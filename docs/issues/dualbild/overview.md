# Dual Build Plan Overview

## ✅ Essential UX/SEO Features - Target of Dual Build Strategy

These Next.js features are **essential for user experience and SEO optimization**. They should **NOT be dropped** but instead become the **core target of the dual-build strategy** - preserved on Vercel while finding alternative implementations for ICP:

| Feature                       | Why It Matters                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server Components**         | Reduces bundle size, improves TTI (Time to Interactive)        |
| **Static Site Generation**    | Enables prerendering of key pages for speed & SEO              |
| **Dynamic Metadata**          | Crucial for SEO, Open Graph, and multi-language support        |
| **Image Optimization**        | Reduces page weight, improves LCP and CLS scores               |
| **Middleware (i18n)**         | Ensures localized URLs, redirects, and SEO per locale          |
| **Server/Client Strategy**    | Mix SSR + CSR components based on data requirements            |
| **Code splitting (by route)** | Automatic with App Router; critical for first load performance |
| **Font Optimization**         | Improves LCP, reduces layout shift                             |

**Dual Build Strategy**: Keep all of the above on **Vercel** for SEO/performance optimization, while implementing alternative approaches on **ICP** for the decentralized version.

## 🎯 **Important: ICP Build Scope**

**Current Goal**: The ICP/Juno build is designed as a **pure client-side React application** for this initial phase.

### **What the ICP Build IS:**

- **Static React SPA** deployed to decentralized hosting
- **UI rendering only** - same components, no server dependencies
- **Independent deployment** - decoupled from Next.js full-stack structure
- **Proof of concept** - demonstrating frontend decentralization

### **What the ICP Build is NOT (for now):**

- **No real backend integration** - no API calls or database connections
- **No server-side rendering** - purely client-side execution
- **No dynamic data** - static content and mock data only
- **No authentication** - UI components only, no auth flow

**Future phases** may add backend integration, but the current focus is **frontend decoupling and independent deployment**.

---

### **Futura-Specific Impact**:

- **Dynamic Metadata**: Critical for 8-language SEO optimization (`en`, `fr`, `es`, `pt`, `it`, `de`, `pl`, `zh`)
- **Image Optimization**: Essential for memory photo performance and LCP scores
- **Server Components**: ~30-50% bundle size reduction for faster memory browsing
- **Middleware (i18n)**: Automatic locale detection for global "Live Forever" mission

## ❌ Non-Essential Features - Excluded from Dual Build Refactor

These are **developer conveniences** that **don't affect user UX or SEO**. To avoid overcomplicating the dual-build codebase, these features will **NOT be part of the dual-build refactor** - they can be dropped for ICP without impacting user experience:

| Feature                                       | Notes                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **File-Based Routing**                        | Developer DX only. You can use `react-router` or manual routing in vanilla React. No SEO impact if SSG is preserved. |
| **API Routes**                                | Drop if you're using a separate backend or canisters. ICP-native dApps don’t need server APIs.                       |
| **Advanced Routing (Parallel, Route Groups)** | Nice-to-have. Mostly about organizing large codebases, not performance or SEO.                                       |
| **Loading UI Files**                          | You can manage loading states in React components instead of file-based handlers.                                    |
| **Error Boundaries per Segment**              | Optional. Can be replaced with top-level React error boundaries.                                                     |
| **Turbopack / Fast Refresh**                  | Dev-time only. Not needed in production or for ICP builds.                                                           |
| **Edge Runtime**                              | Vercel-specific performance optimization. No equivalent on ICP.                                                      |
| **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**              | Dev-only. Not needed at runtime.                                                                                     |
| **PostHog Middleware**                        | Analytics helpers, not needed in a decentralized context unless you self-host.                                       |
| **ESLint & Lint Scripts**                     | Development tooling. Has no effect on runtime or SEO.                                                                |

## 🔀 Optional: Can Be Replaced or Simulated

| Feature                             | Replacement in Vanilla React / ICP Context                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **generateStaticParams**            | You can statically build localized routes with a build script      |
| **Middleware (analytics)**          | Use client-side tracking or ICP logging canister                   |
| **Server/Client Boundary**          | You’ll need to manually separate SSR and CSR logic                 |
| **Onboarding Providers / Contexts** | Still usable in Vanilla React or Juno                              |
| **NextAuth**                        | Replace with Internet Identity, OAuth flow, or crypto login on ICP |
| **Blob Upload**                     | Use ICP blob storage or web3.filecoin/IPFS equivalent              |

## 🧠 TL;DR – Keep or Drop?

| Feature Type                | Keep for SEO / Perf | Drop / Replace for ICP |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Static generation (SSG)     | ✅                  | —                      |
| Dynamic metadata            | ✅                  | —                      |
| Server Components           | ✅ (Vercel)         | ❌ (Not usable on ICP) |
| Image optimization          | ✅                  | Optional               |
| Routing (App Router)        | ❌ (DX only)        | ✅ (Custom w/ React)   |
| API routes                  | ❌                  | ✅ (Replace with ICP)  |
| Middleware                  | Depends             | Replace or remove      |
| Developer tools (lint, dev) | ❌                  | Not runtime relevant   |

## 🎯 **Implementation Priority**

### **Phase 1: Essential UX/SEO Features** (High Priority)

Focus dual-build architecture on preserving these critical user-facing benefits:

1. **Server Components** → Vercel (native) + ICP (client-side equivalent)
2. **Dynamic Metadata** → Vercel (generateMetadata) + ICP (static build script)
3. **Image Optimization** → Vercel (next/image) + ICP (manual optimization)
4. **i18n Middleware** → Vercel (automatic) + ICP (client-side routing)

### **Phase 2: Non-Essential Features** (Low Priority)

These can be simplified or dropped entirely without dual implementation:

- File-based routing → Use react-router on ICP only
- API routes → Replace with separate Web2 backend API
- Development tooling → Keep for Vercel development only

This prioritization ensures **maximum user value** with **minimum development complexity**.

## 🏗️ **Dual-Build Architecture Strategy**

### **Single Codebase, Dual Deployments**

**Core Concept**: One shared codebase that compiles into two different deployment targets with build-time feature stripping.

```
Same Source Code
├── Next.js Build (Vercel) → Keeps all Next.js features
└── React SPA Build (ICP) → Strips Next.js features at build time
```

### **Development Workflow:**

- **Single component library** - all UI components developed together
- **Shared business logic** and utilities
- **Conditional compilation** - platform-specific code marked with build flags
- **Zero synchronization issues** - impossible for components to drift

### **Build Process:**

- **Vercel build**: Standard Next.js compilation with SSR, API routes, image optimization
- **ICP build**: Webpack/Vite strips Next.js imports, outputs vanilla React SPA
- **Platform abstraction**: Build-time replacement of Next.js features with vanilla equivalents

### **Build-Time Feature Flags:**

- **Vite `define`**: `BUILD_TARGET: '"icp"'` for environment-based tree shaking
- **Webpack `DefinePlugin`**: Conditional compilation for Next.js features
- **Babel transforms**: `babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables` for clean builds

### **Box 1: Next.js Full-Stack (Vercel)**

```
Next.js Build from Shared Codebase
├── Frontend (React components + Next.js features)
├── Backend (API routes)
└── Database connection (PostgreSQL)
```

**Self-contained monolith** - Next.js handles everything internally with direct database access.

### **Box 2: Decoupled Frontend + Backend (ICP + Web2)**

```
React SPA Build from Same Codebase ──HTTP calls──> Web2 Backend API ──> PostgreSQL DB
(Next.js features stripped at build time)                               (same database)
```

**Separated services** - React frontend on ICP calls external Web2 backend API.

### **Key Architectural Benefits:**

#### **Shared Codebase Benefits:**

- **Zero synchronization issues** - single source of truth for all components
- **Consistent user experience** - identical UI across both platforms
- **Unified development workflow** - write once, deploy twice
- **Shared bug fixes** - improvements benefit both platforms automatically

#### **Complete Deployment Separation:**

- **No interference** between the two deployment systems
- **Independent deployment** cycles and optimization strategies
- **Clean boundaries** - each deployment optimized for its purpose

#### **Shared Database Layer:**

- **Single PostgreSQL instance** - no data synchronization complexity
- **Consistent user experience** - same data regardless of platform choice
- **Seamless platform switching** - users can move between Web2/Web3 versions

#### **Platform Optimization:**

- **Next.js Box**: Optimized for SEO, performance, server-side rendering
- **React SPA Box**: Optimized for decentralization, client-side rendering, ICP hosting

### **Data Flow:**

- **Vercel users**: Next.js Build → API routes → PostgreSQL
- **ICP users**: React SPA Build → Web2 Backend API → PostgreSQL (same database)
- **Result**: Zero data fragmentation, zero code duplication, maximum platform flexibility

### **Build-Time Feature Stripping Examples:**

#### **Image Optimization:**

```typescript
// Same component, different compilation targets
function MemoryCard({ memory }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{memory.title}</h3>

      {/* Vercel build: Next.js Image component */}
      {BUILD_TARGET === "nextjs" && <Image src={memory.image} width={300} height={200} />}

      {/* ICP build: Standard img tag */}
      {BUILD_TARGET === "icp" && <img src={memory.image} alt={memory.title} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **Routing:**

- **Vercel build**: Uses Next.js App Router file-based routing
- **ICP build**: Build process converts to React Router configuration
- **Same page components**, different routing implementations

#### **i18n Fallback Strategy for ICP:**

- **Vercel**: Middleware-based automatic locale detection and redirects
- **ICP**: Client-side detection using `window.navigator.language` + URL parsing
- **Fallback chain**: URL locale → Browser language → Default (en)
- **Implementation**: React Router with locale-based routing + `react-i18next` for translations
