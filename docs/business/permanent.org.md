**Report: Evaluating the Claims and Structure of the Permanent Legacy Foundation**

---

### 1. Introduction

The Permanent Legacy Foundation (legally registered as the Permrecord Foundation) presents itself as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide all people with secure, perpetual access to their digital legacy. Through its website and public communications, it emphasizes transparency, data ownership, and long-term preservation of user content without subscriptions, surveillance, or loss of control.

At the same time, criticisms raised in the Wikipedia article about Dean Drako, the Foundation's founder, have questioned the organization's financial transparency, governance structure, public support claims, and the accuracy of its stated mission. This report evaluates those claims using publicly available data, especially the Foundation's annual IRS Form 990 filings.

### 2. What is Form 990?

IRS Form 990 is the annual tax return required for most tax-exempt organizations in the United States. It provides detailed information about a nonprofit's revenue, expenses, governance, and compliance with tax regulations. It also includes critical appendices (Schedules A–O) that reveal:

- Public support percentages
- Executive compensation
- Contributions from major donors
- Governance and ownership structure

Form 990s are public documents and serve as an essential tool for transparency and public accountability.

### 3. Claims Made by the Permanent Legacy Foundation

On its website (permanent.org), the Foundation makes several key claims:

- It is a public charity dedicated to perpetual digital preservation.
- There are no recurring fees, data mining, or loss of user rights.
- Donations are pooled into an "endowment" to fund long-term access.
- The nonprofit operates independently, governed by a board.

These statements position the Foundation as a publicly accountable and financially sustainable alternative to commercial cloud storage services.

### 4. Critiques from Wikipedia

The Wikipedia article on Dean Drako alleges:

- The Foundation is fully controlled by Drako, its founder and only member.
- It has minimal or zero public support and is instead funded primarily by Drako.
- There is no evidence of an actual endowment, despite claims on its website.
- Its legal name and status are not easily accessible on the public-facing site.
- The Foundation contracts with Permrecord, Inc., a for-profit company also founded by Drako.

### 5. Analysis of Form 990 Filings (2016–2023)

#### a. Governance Structure

- **Confirmed**: Dean Drako is the **sole legal member** of the Permrecord Foundation.
- This grants him full legal control, including the ability to override or remove board members, amend bylaws, and dissolve the organization.
- While a board of six independent directors exists (including well-known figures such as Stephen Wolfram and Brewster Kahle), it is **advisory in practice**, not sovereign.

#### b. Endowment Status

- Across **eight years** of Form 990 filings (2016–2023), there is **no record of any endowment**.
- No funds are designated as restricted, invested, or otherwise set aside for perpetuity.
- Therefore, the claim that donations are "invested into an endowment" is **not supported** by the financial filings.

#### c. Financial Sustainability

- The organization operated at a **loss** in five of the eight years analyzed.
- In 2018, after two years of dwindling donations and over $1 million in spending, net assets dropped from $1.88M (2016) to just $267K.
- The organization continued with modest revenue from 2019 onward, mostly through one or two large donations.

#### d. Public Charity vs. Private Foundation

- To qualify as a public charity, at least **33.3% of revenue** must come from the general public.
- In 2022, the Foundation reported **only 21.13% public support**, confirming that it did **not meet** this threshold.
- In 2023, the public support percentage reached **37.41%**, allowing the Foundation to qualify as a public charity under IRS rules **for the first time**.

#### e. Major Donor Dependence

- Schedule B filings reveal the Foundation received **over $3.5 million** from one or two major donors from 2019–2023.
- These contributions accounted for more than half of total revenue in that period.
- While donor identities are redacted, it is highly likely that Drako is among them.

#### f. Payments to Permrecord, Inc.

- Despite Wikipedia's claim, no Form 990 discloses **any payments to Permrecord, Inc.**, the for-profit company founded by Drako.
- Instead, the Foundation paid independent contractors such as Victory Square Partners and Open Tech Strategies for software development.
- However, the Foundation does **not hide** its connection to the Permrecord name. On its site, it openly states that the legal name is Permrecord Foundation and that it does business as (DBA) the Permanent Legacy Foundation.

---

### 6. Conclusion

The Permanent Legacy Foundation promotes an idealistic vision of ethical digital preservation through nonprofit values. However, its historical financial records show:

- A long dependence on a single funder (likely Drako)
- A governance model that centers full legal control in that same individual
- A public endowment claim that has no basis in accounting records

While it did achieve public charity status by IRS standards in 2023 and does not appear to be engaging in financial self-dealing, the Foundation's marketing may overstate its independence and sustainability.

Ultimately, while **not fraudulent**, the Foundation presents a **mission-driven narrative that is not fully matched by its governance and financial structure**, especially prior to 2023.

Stakeholders and donors should be aware of this context when evaluating the organization or contributing to its mission.
