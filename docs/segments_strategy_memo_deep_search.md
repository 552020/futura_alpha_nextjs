# Information Note: Futura Digital Preservation Platform - Targeted User Experiences

## Project Overview

Futura is a digital preservation platform designed to help users safeguard their memories, documents, and digital legacy for future generations. The platform allows users to upload, organize, and securely store important digital assets with the promise that these will be preserved long-term, potentially beyond the user's lifetime.

## Core Value Proposition

**"Live Forever. Now."** – Futura enables users to preserve their digital legacy, ensuring that important memories and information remain accessible to future generations regardless of technological changes or personal circumstances.

## Target Audiences

Futura serves multiple distinct user segments, each with different preservation needs:

1. **Personal** – Individuals preserving their own memories and digital assets  
2. **Family** – Users focused on preserving family history and generational connections  
3. **Business** – Organizations preserving institutional knowledge and company history  
4. **Creative** – Artists, writers, and creators preserving their portfolio and work  
5. **Academic** – Researchers and educators preserving scholarly work and research data  

## Current Architecture Challenge

We need to implement a system that delivers tailored user experiences (**content, imagery, messaging, and design**) to different target audiences **without requiring users to self-select their segment**. This is primarily for **marketing effectiveness, personalization, and A/B testing**.

We are evaluating different methods for achieving this and need **clear recommendations on the best approach** based on scalability, ease of implementation, SEO impact, and performance. Specifically, we need insights on:

- The best way to implement **targeted content delivery** in a Next.js app
- **SEO-friendly personalization** strategies
- **Best practices for A/B testing personalized experiences**
- **Industry standards** for personalized content segmentation

### **Key Requirements:**

1. **Invisible Targeting** – Users should not be aware they're seeing a targeted version  
2. **Marketing Campaign Support** – Must support targeted ad campaigns (e.g., Instagram ads targeting creatives in Berlin)  
3. **Clean URLs** – Preferably use path-based targeting (`futura.com/family`) for marketing while maintaining SEO benefits  
4. **A/B Testing Capability** – Support testing different content/designs for each segment and provide meaningful analytics  
5. **Analytics Integration** – Track performance metrics by target segment to measure effectiveness  
6. **Internationalization** – Must work alongside language localization  

### **Architectural Approaches Considered:**
We are currently evaluating different approaches and need guidance on which one is the **most effective for our use case**:

- **Path-based targeting** (`futura.com/family`)  
- **Subdomain-based targeting** (`family.futura.com`)  
- **Query parameter targeting** (`futura.com?target=family`)  
- **Cookie/session-based targeting** (no URL indicator)  

We need a recommendation on **which approach is best** for balancing:
- **SEO performance** (indexability and ranking)
- **Scalability** (handling multiple user segments efficiently)
- **Personalization accuracy** (ensuring the right content is shown)
- **Implementation complexity** (how difficult it is to build and maintain)

## Research Questions

We are looking for answers to the following key questions to **inform our decision-making**:

1. **Which approach (path-based, subdomain, query parameters, or cookies) is the best fit for our use case?**
2. **What are best practices for implementing audience-targeted experiences in modern web applications?**
3. **How do companies like Netflix, Spotify, or other personalization-heavy platforms handle different user segments, and which strategies are most applicable to our needs?**
4. **What technical approaches balance SEO requirements with personalized experiences?**
5. **What are the most effective A/B testing methodologies for validating our personalization strategy?**
6. **Which analytics approaches best measure the effectiveness of targeted experiences?**
7. **Are there any case studies of companies successfully implementing similar targeting systems?**

## Technical Context

Our current tech stack consists of:

- **Next.js application with App Router**
- **Internationalization already implemented via `[lang]` path parameter**
- **Server and client components**
- **Tailwind CSS for styling**

Given this context, we need insights into **the most effective way to implement audience segmentation and personalization** in a Next.js application **while maintaining SEO and analytics tracking**.

### **Decision Needed**
- Which **targeting approach** should we implement?  
- What are **A/B testing best practices** specific to **personalized user experiences**?  
- How should we **measure effectiveness** using analytics?

**Please provide insights, case studies, and technical recommendations to help us make an informed decision.**
