## What is `tsx`?

`tsx` is a tool for running TypeScript and JavaScript files directly without needing to first compile TypeScript into JavaScript. It's part of the `tsx` package and provides an easy, zero-config way to execute TypeScript files.

### Key Features of `tsx`:
- **Run TypeScript directly**: No need to pre-compile `.ts` files.
- **Fast setup**: Works out of the box without additional configuration.
- **Supports modern features**: Compatible with the latest TypeScript and ECMAScript syntax.
- **Alternative to `ts-node`**: Often faster and more optimized for performance.

You can install `tsx` globally or use it via `npx` as shown in this guide.
