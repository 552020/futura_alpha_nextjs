## Notes

- **Mock Data Toggle**: Use flag in main gallery component (similar to dashboard pattern)
- **API Integration**: Leverage existing `/api/galleries` endpoints with enhancements for public access control
- **Database Schema**: Defer schema enhancements (coverImageId, allowDownloads) to Phase 2
- **Cover Image Logic**: Compute cover image on read using position → createdAt → placeholder logic
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement at gallery page level with graceful fallback UI
- **Performance**: Focus on Next.js Image optimization and lazy loading for MVP

## Critical Technical Requirements

- **Route Structure**: Public galleries on `/g/:id` (no auth), private on `/[lang]/gallery/[id]` (auth required)
- **Access Control**: API must filter published items only for public routes, prevent auth leakage
- **Image Dimensions**: MANDATORY storage of width/height in metadata to prevent layout shift
- **Position Integrity**: Unique positions per gallery, gapless after deletes, bulk reorder support
- **Focus Management**: Mandatory focus trap in lightbox with aria-hidden background
- **Prefetching**: Prefetch adjacent images on lightbox open for smooth navigation
- **Analytics Shim**: Implement track(event, props) function now for future analytics integration

## Component Reuse Strategy

- **shadcn/ui Components**: Use existing shadcn/ui components (Dialog, Card, Button, Form, Badge, etc.) for consistent UI
- **Memory Viewer**: Investigate reusing `src/components/memory-viewer.tsx` for ImageLightbox to avoid duplication
- **MemoryGrid Pattern**: Consider adapting existing `MemoryGrid` component patterns for gallery image display
- **Form Components**: Reuse existing form patterns from dashboard and onboarding components

## Parallel Development Tasks

Tasks marked as "PARALLEL TASK" can be worked on simultaneously by different team members:

- **Task 1**: Mock data generation (independent script creation)
- **Task 2**: TypeScript interfaces (foundational types)
- **Task 18**: API endpoints (backend-focused work)

Other tasks have dependencies and should be completed sequentially within each phase.
