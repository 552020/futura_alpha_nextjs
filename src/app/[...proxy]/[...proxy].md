# [...proxy] Route Handler

The [...proxy] folder demonstrates how to handle authenticated requests to third-party backends. While we're not currently using this feature in our project, it's a powerful pattern documented in the Auth.js tutorial.

## Overview

Imagine you have a React/Next.js frontend application that needs to communicate with a separate backend service (like a Java Spring Boot API or a Python Django API). For security reasons, this backend requires an access token with each request.

The [...proxy] route acts as middleware that:

1. Takes incoming requests from your frontend
2. Adds the authentication token from the user's session
3. Forwards the request to your backend
4. Returns the response back to the frontend

## Use Cases

This pattern is particularly useful when:

- Your frontend needs to communicate with a protected backend API
- You need to forward authentication tokens securely
- You want to maintain consistent API paths between frontend and backend
- You need to handle CORS or other cross-origin issues

## Future Implementation

While we're not currently using this feature, it's documented here for future reference when we need to integrate with external APIs or services that require authentication.
