# Share Route Checklist

## Already Implemented ‚úÖ

- [x] Memory exists check (using `findMemory`)
- [x] Target user exists in `allUsers` table
- [x] User email exists (for both permanent and temporary users)
- [x] Ownership verification (using `ownerAllUserId`)
- [x] Onboarding user validation (if applicable)
- [x] Basic group sharing placeholder (returns 501)

## Still Need to Implement ‚ùå

### Critical

- [ ] Duplicate share check (prevent sharing the same memory multiple times with the same user)
- [ ] Memory type validation (ensure we're not sharing unsupported types)
- [ ] Access level validation (currently hardcoded to "read" in the schema)

### Important

- [ ] Share expiration (if we want to implement time-limited shares)
- [ ] Maximum shares limit (if we want to limit how many times a memory can be shared)
- [ ] Group validation (when group sharing is implemented)
- [ ] Rate limiting (prevent abuse of the share endpoint)

### Email Sending Checks üîç

- [ ] Email Service Configuration
  - [ ] Verify email service is properly configured
  - [ ] Add error handling for email service failures
  - [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed emails
  - [ ] Add logging for email sending attempts

- [ ] Email Content Validation
  - [ ] Validate email addresses format
  - [ ] Check for empty or malformed email content
  - [ ] Validate email templates exist and are properly formatted
  - [ ] Add fallback templates for when primary templates fail

- [ ] Rate Limiting & Quotas
  - [ ] Implement per-user email sending limits
  - [ ] Add daily/weekly email quotas
  - [ ] Add cooldown period between emails to same recipient
  - [ ] Track email sending history

- [ ] Email Preferences
  - [ ] Check if user has opted out of emails
  - [ ] Respect user's email preferences
  - [ ] Add unsubscribe links to emails
  - [ ] Handle email bounces and complaints

- [ ] Security
  - [ ] Sanitize email content to prevent XSS
  - [ ] Validate email attachments
  - [ ] Add SPF/DKIM records
  - [ ] Implement email authentication

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Memory size/type restrictions for sharing (if we want to limit what can be shared)
- [ ] Relationship validation (ensure the relationship type is valid for the target user)
- [ ] Email sending limits (prevent spam)
