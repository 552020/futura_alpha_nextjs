# Wedding Memories

## Narrative Concept

Futura serves as the ultimate wedding gift that transcends traditional presents. This segment positions Futura as a collaborative time capsule for newlyweds, where friends, family, and wedding guests can contribute memories, photos, videos, and messages that the couple will discover and cherish throughout their marriage milestones. The focus is on creating an unforgettable gift that grows more meaningful with each passing year, designed for gift-givers rather than the couples themselves.

### Target Audience

Wedding guests, family members, and friends looking for meaningful, unique wedding gifts that go beyond traditional registry items. These are gift-givers who want to offer something truly special that will be treasured for a lifetime and create lasting emotional impact. Secondary audience includes wedding planners and those organizing group gifts.
