# Family (Black Mirror alt)

## Narrative Concept

We present Futura's value proposition for the "family" segment in a dystopian, over-exaggerated, and darkly humorous way.
Our story begins with simple, warm moments—a woman on her wedding day, then three generations later: the same woman (now a grandmother), her daughter, and her young granddaughter looking at that wedding photo together.
The story then shifts to the grandmother's deathbed scene. While tastefully presented with family around her, this moment feels slightly off for typical advertising, creating a subtle sense of unease.
As the grandmother passes away, we see her house burning down, with the wedding photo in the foreground being consumed by flames—suggesting these events are happening simultaneously, and with her death comes the loss of physical memories.
After this, we depict the unreliability of mainstream storage solutions through a diptych: on one side, an email announcing "Service Discontinuation" and "Your stored memories have been deleted. We thank you for your loyalty over the years"; on the other side, Jeff Bezos himself shutting down the servers where these precious memories were supposedly safe.
After these increasingly bleak scenarios, we end with an almost too-perfect solution: Futura saving these precious memories when everything else failed.

### Target Audience

Culturally-engaged professionals in their 30s-50s who approach both media and technology with educated skepticism—the type who appreciate the dark comedy of Coen Brothers films, Tarantino's bold stylistic choices, and prestige television like "Succession," who discuss Charlie Kaufman's narrative complexity during dinner parties, and who value brands that acknowledge uncomfortable truths rather than offering sanitized messaging. These consumers seek intellectual engagement in their entertainment and expect the same thoughtfulness from the products and services they choose.

### Relation to Family Segment

This narrative is deliberately exaggerated and dystopian, contrasting with a more neutral, emotional, family-oriented narrative segment ("Family") designed to present the same values (long-term preservation, legacy, and connection) without employing provocative or unsettling imagery. The two narratives target different emotional and intellectual reactions from audiences to showcase the versatility and importance of digital preservation with Futura.

## Scene Breakdown & Suggested Text Options

### Scene 1: Wedding Day

**Visual:** A couple getting married.

"We collect these moment, and we share them with our beloved ones, through generations."
"We collect these moments, cherish them, and pass them on—generation after generation."

### Scene 3: Grandmother's Deathbed

**Visual:** The grandmother, surrounded by family in a hospital bed.

**Intention:** Present death in a peaceful, harmonious way that acknowledges mortality while emphasizing the continuity of family connection, creating a subtle tonal shift in the narrative, just for the fact of displaying death.

**Possible Text:**

- "Time passes, and we with it. Family remains."
- "We follow the passing time. Family remains."

### Scene 4: Grandmother's House Burning

**Visual:** The house burning, with the wedding photo consumed by flames in the foreground, while the grandmother is dying.

**Intention:** Create a jarring emotional contrast through deliberate over-exaggeration—the highly unlikely simultaneous loss of both the person and their physical memories—to dramatically highlight the vulnerability of traditional memory preservation methods.

**Possible Text:**

- "Memories are fragile. Houses burn down. Ashes to ashes."

### Scene 5: AWS Shutdown and Storage Deletion

**Visual:** A diptych: on one side, an email announcing "Service Discontinuation" and "Your stored memories have been deleted. We thank you for your loyalty over the years"; on the other side, Jeff Bezos himself shutting down the servers where these precious memories were supposedly safe.

**Intention:** Highlight the vulnerability of digital storage solutions by showing how even the most powerful tech companies can arbitrarily end services, leaving consumers with nothing but a corporate "thank you."

**Possible Text:**

- - "You trusted Jeff's cloud. Now it's vaporized."
- "You thought the cloud was forever? Think again. Servers shut down. Corporations move on. Your memories vanish with them."
- "The cloud: just someone else's computer that can be turned off."

---

### Scene 6: Resolution through Futura

**Visual:** People looking at the wedding photo through Futura, perfectly preserved despite all previous disasters.

**Intention:** Present Futura as a deus ex machina solution that miraculously resolves all the previously established problems.

**Possible Text:**

- "We are your happy end."
- "With Futura, your memories survive fires, outlive tech giants, and defy time itself. Some things deserve to be truly immortal."
