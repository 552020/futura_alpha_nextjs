# Middleware Package Explanations

## 1. @formatjs/intl-localematcher

- Implements the locale negotiation algorithm (RFC 4647)
- The 'match' function finds the best locale match between user preferences and supported locales
- Takes user's preferred languages, supported locales, and a default locale
- Returns the best matching locale based on these inputs

## 2. Negotiator

- Parses HTTP headers for content negotiation
- The 'languages()' method extracts and orders language preferences from the Accept-Language header
- Respects quality values (q-values) to determine the user's language priority
- Provides an ordered array of language codes that represent user preferences

## 3. NextResponse

- Part of Next.js server middleware API
- Used to create and return HTTP responses from middleware
- The 'redirect()' method creates a redirect response to send users to the localized URL
- Allows us to modify the request/response cycle before rendering pages

## Path Construction Process

### 1. Creating the Path String

The path is constructed using:

- `/${locale}` - Adds the detected locale with a leading slash (e.g., "/de")
- `${pathname.startsWith("/") ? "" : "/"}` - Prevents double slashes
- `${pathname}` - Adds the original pathname

Examples:

- If pathname is "/about" → "/de/about" (avoids "/de//about")
- If pathname is "products" → "/de/products" (adds necessary slash)

### 2. Creating a URL Object

```javascript
new URL(path, request.url);
```

- Creates a new URL object using the constructed path and original request URL as base
- Preserves URL components:
  - Protocol (http/https)
  - Domain
  - Port
  - Query parameters
  - Hash fragments

Example:

- If request.url is "https://example.com/about?id=123"
- The new URL becomes "https://example.com/de/about?id=123"

### 3. Creating the Redirect Response

```javascript
NextResponse.redirect(url);
```

- Creates an HTTP redirect response (status 307 Temporary Redirect)
- Tells the browser to navigate to the new URL
- Preserves the original HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)

## What This Accomplishes

This middleware ensures:

1. Users are redirected to the same page but with their preferred locale in the URL
2. The URL structure is clean (no double slashes)
3. All URL components (query parameters, etc.) are preserved
4. The redirect happens with the appropriate HTTP status code

This is a crucial part of the internationalization strategy, ensuring all pages are accessed with the proper language context in the URL.

## The getLocale Function

The getLocale function handles language detection and matching:

1. Extracts HTTP headers from the incoming request
2. Uses Negotiator to parse the Accept-Language header into an ordered array of preferred languages
3. Uses intl-localematcher to find the best match between user preferences and supported locales
4. Returns the best matching locale, or falls back to the default locale if no match is found
5. Includes logging to help debug the language detection process
