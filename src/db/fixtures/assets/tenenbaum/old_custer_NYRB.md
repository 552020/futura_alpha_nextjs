**Title: “The Frontier of Bad Taste”**  
**By: Marguerite Glass**

Eli Cash’s _Old Custer_ reads like a fever dream penned during a peyote retreat in Taos—appropriately, it probably was. A speculative reimagining of the Battle of Little Bighorn in which General Custer survives, retires to Santa Fe, and becomes a self-help guru, the novel straddles the precarious line between revisionist Western and literary farce. Unfortunately, it rarely stays upright.

Cash, who gained notoriety for his "post-spiritual cowboy aesthetic" (a term he apparently coined himself), appears less interested in narrative cohesion than in flamboyant metaphor and dubious historical insight. In one scene, Custer reflects, “I did not die in battle—but I perish in every breakfast I take alone.” What does this mean? Is it profound? Is it nonsense? Cash seems to prefer leaving us in the dark—or worse, in the desert.

There is, however, an undeniable confidence in the prose. Cash writes with the swagger of someone who’s never been told “no.” He litters the pages with pseudo-philosophical tangents about masculinity, horses, and the soul of the American frontier, frequently likening Custer to Christ, then retracting the comparison only to reintroduce it two pages later “as a metaphor wearing spurs.”

The book has its defenders—primarily in fringe academic circles and among those nostalgic for the kind of pulp paperbacks that came with cigarette burns pre-installed. But one cannot help wondering: is Cash in on the joke, or is he the joke?

_Old Custer_ may very well achieve cult status, but if it does, it will be for reasons literary purists will mourn for decades. Still, one can’t say it isn’t original. Or, in the words of the protagonist: “History is only what survives the whiskey.”
