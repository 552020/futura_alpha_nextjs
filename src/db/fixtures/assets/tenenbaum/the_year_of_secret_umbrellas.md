## **CAST**

- **CLEMENCE** – A 16-year-old girl with a prosthetic index finger and a fondness for sad operas.
- **EDGAR** – Her adoptive brother, a chess prodigy who hasn't spoken aloud since the Reagan inauguration.
- **MOTHER (voice only)** – A Danish ornithologist who calls weekly from Antarctica.
- **A BLIND DOG** – (portrayed by a taxidermied beagle on wheels).

## **SCENE ONE**

_(The stage is a windowless room. A red telephone rings. Clemence sits cross-legged on a small cot, painting her toenails black. Edgar stands by the wall, slowly moving invisible chess pieces.)_

**CLEMENCE**  
You can’t just stare at the wallpaper forever. Eventually it stares back, and it’s always disappointed.

_(No response. The telephone stops ringing. A moment passes.)_

**CLEMENCE**  
She won’t call again. You know how she gets when the penguins molt.

_(Edgar sets down an imaginary bishop. He scribbles something on a notepad and slides it toward her. She reads aloud.)_

**CLEMENCE** _(reading)_  
_"I dreamt you were drowning in an aquarium. You smiled the whole time."_  
You always write like a French person who’s never been in love.

**EDGAR** _(mimes a shrug)_

**CLEMENCE**  
Do you think we’re tragic? Or just bored?

_(Beat.)_  
Never mind. I already know.

## **SCENE TWO**

_(Later. The cot is gone. The taxidermied dog is now center stage. Clemence lights a cigarette she doesn’t inhale.)_

**CLEMENCE**  
The blind dog says he forgives us. That’s more than you’ve ever said.

_(Edgar wheels the dog in a small circle.)_

**CLEMENCE** _(almost tenderly)_  
Remember when we thought we’d fake our own disappearances and live in a lighthouse in Portugal?  
You said I could be the ghost and you’d do the haunting.

_(The red telephone rings again. She doesn’t answer it.)_

**VOICE OF MOTHER (filtered, distant)**  
Clemence? Edgar? I saw a tern today. It reminded me of your father. Or maybe it was a trick of the fog.

_(The line goes dead. Clemence picks up the dog and exits without looking back. Edgar is alone with the invisible chessboard.)_

**BLACKOUT.**
