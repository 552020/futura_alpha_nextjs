### _Frontier Reimagined: A Quarterly Journal of Western Speculative Fiction_\*\*

**Title: “Custer Rides Again—and So Does the Genre”**  
**By: Truman Bellamy**

When Eli Cash’s _Old Custer_ hit the shelves like a shot of mescaline to the heart of historical fiction, the literary world didn’t know what to make of it. That’s because _Old Custer_ isn’t here to make sense—it’s here to make _history_ bend, break, and bleed technicolor.

Cash’s vision of a surviving General George Armstrong Custer living on past Little Bighorn, mentoring wayward poets in the desert and predicting the arrival of the internet (“A silver telegraph with no end”), is the kind of genre-defying ambition we haven’t seen since early Pynchon—if Pynchon had grown up on Louis L’Amour and peyote buttons.

This is speculative Western at its weirdest and most wonderful. Cash blends anachronism and allegory with audacity, building a version of America that is neither real nor quite imagined—somewhere in the dreamspace where myth lives. He gives us a Custer who meditates, fears reincarnation as a mule, and tries to patent a “dust-powered carriage.”

Critics have derided Cash for his bombastic style, his disregard for historical fidelity, and his tendency to write dialogue like it’s meant to be performed at a séance. But they miss the point. _Old Custer_ isn’t about what _was_—it’s about what _might have been_, had one bullet missed.

The book’s final image—Custer riding into a New Mexico thunderstorm shouting “Tell Sitting Bull I forgive him, but I’ll be late”—is among the most haunting in recent memory.

Cash is a madman. And in this case, the West needed one.
